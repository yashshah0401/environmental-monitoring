# Environmental Monitoring System â€“ Project Repository

This repository outlines the complete lifecycle of the Environmental Monitoring System project, designed to monitor air and water quality in real-time across regional environments.

## Project Title

**Environmental Monitoring System â€“ Tracking Air and Water Quality in the Region**

---

## Purpose

To build a sensor-integrated system for real-time tracking of air and water metrics, enabling:

- Public health awareness  
- Environmental research  
- Data-informed policy making  
- Transparency through dashboards and alerts

### Deliverable 2 â€“ Functional and System Requirements

This deliverable translates stakeholder needs into clearly defined functional and non-functional requirements. It includes:

- A comprehensive list of SMART functional requirements covering data collection, visualization, alerting, and user roles.
- System environment details, including required hardware (ESP32, air/water sensors) and software components (React, Node.js, Firebase).
- Non-functional goals such as system uptime, response time, multilingual support, and security standards.
- Key assumptions about infrastructure and data access.
- Validation strategy through unit tests, field deployment, UAT, and security checks.

These requirements form the foundation for system design and development in future phases.
