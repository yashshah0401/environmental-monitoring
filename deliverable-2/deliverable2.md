# Deliverable 2: Functional and System Requirements

---

## 1. Introduction

This deliverable translates the findings and goals from Deliverable 1 into clear, actionable **functional and system requirements**. These requirements aim to support the development of a real-time environmental monitoring system, ensuring it meets the needs of stakeholders such as residents, environmental agencies, researchers, and policymakers. All requirements are designed to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound) and reflect best practices for requirement elicitation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

The functional requirements describe what the system should do. These are derived directly from stakeholder needs and the high-level features outlined in Deliverable 1.
