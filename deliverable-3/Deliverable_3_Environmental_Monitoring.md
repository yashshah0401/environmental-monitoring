- **User Story:** *As a researcher, I want accurate water quality data from lakes and rivers so that I can assess contamination trends.*
- **Assigned To:** IoT Developer
- **Estimated Effort:** 1.5 days

---

### Task 3: Establish Cloud Database

- **Description:** Implement Firebase or InfluxDB to store time-series sensor data with indexing and retention policies.
- **User Story:** *As a backend engineer, I want to store and retrieve historical sensor data so that the dashboard can show past pollution trends.*
- **Assigned To:** Backend Developer
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### Task 4: Design and Build Dashboard UI

- **Description:** Create interactive dashboard using React or Angular to show live data, maps, charts, and alerts.
- **User Story:** *As a user, I want to see air and water quality on a live dashboard so that I can take precautions if levels are unsafe.*
- **Assigned To:** Frontend Developer
- **Estimated Effort:** 2 days

---

### Task 5: Implement Notification Alerts

- **Description:** Set up Twilio and SendGrid for real-time alerts (email/SMS) when pollution exceeds thresholds.
- **User Story:** *As a resident, I want to be alerted when pollution exceeds safe levels so that I can avoid going outside.*
- **Assigned To:** Backend Developer
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### Task 6: Develop Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Description:** Implement authentication and different access levels for public, researchers, and admins.
- **User Story:** *As an admin, I want to manage user access and permissions so that the system remains secure.*
- **Assigned To:** Backend Developer
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### Task 7: Export Data Functionality

- **Description:** Allow users to download pollution reports in CSV and PDF formats.
- **User Story:** *As a researcher, I want to download pollution data so I can use it in my reports and analysis.*
- **Assigned To:** Full Stack Developer
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### Task 8: Performance Optimization

- **Description:** Conduct load testing and caching implementation to maintain system responsiveness under traffic.
- **User Story:** *As a system owner, I want the dashboard to work smoothly even with many users online.*
- **Assigned To:** DevOps Engineer
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### Task 9: Security Setup

- **Description:** Apply HTTPS, access tokens, and data encryption using AES-256.
- **User Story:** *As a developer, I want all data to be encrypted in transit and storage so that user information remains private.*
- **Assigned To:** Security Engineer
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 day

---

### Task 10: Field Testing and Validation

- **Description:** Deploy sensors at 3 real-world sites and validate data transmission and UI output.
- **User Story:** *As a QA engineer, I want to test the full system in the field so I can ensure all modules work in real conditions.*
- **Assigned To:** QA + IoT Developer
- **Estimated Effort:** 2 days
